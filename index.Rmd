## Some general reflections

--

- **Changing plans is fine**

  - My pre-pandemic plans were very different to what actually happened but it still turned out ok for me
  - Opportunities might arise and you’re not ready or viceversa and that’s normal 

--

- **Deep focus or broader knowledge**: Understanding which fits best for you can really help

--

- **Being part of a community** (R-Ladies Melbourne, Fems) really helped to make meaningful connections & support network, especially if you're trying to enter into a new field 

--

- **Look for opportunities to stand out**: online presence; giving talks; volunteers at groups of interest; social media presence  

--

- Meet and network with people when not in person:
  - Reach out and connect with someone after you’ve met them at an event 
  - A few people reached out during over the lockdowns to ask for career advice or general suggestions
  - I was told from a mentor: "People love to be asked for help!"
